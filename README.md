## General Information
- A US-based housing company named **Surprise Housing** has decided to enter the Australian market. 
- The company wants to know **Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house**.
- The company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia between 2006 and 2010.
- **Using regularized models** (Ridge and Lasso Regression) we will model the housing prices with the available independent variables.

## Technologies Used
- Pandas version:  1.3.4
- Seaborn version:  0.11.2
- Matplotlib version:  3.4.3
- numpy version:  1.20.3
- SKLearn version:  0.24.2

## Conclusions
- It is possible to model the housing price with provided variables.
- Lasso Regression model performed better than Ridge Regression in terms of scoring metrics and feature selection.
- Features selected by Lasso Regression model can be logically and easily explained in terms of business.
